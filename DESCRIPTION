Description: The package MobasyModel consists of a physical model for calculating the energy demand for heating and domestic hot water.
    Monitoring indicators (Energy Profile Indicators) or detailed building data may be used as input data.
    For a simple energy performance calculation the function EnergyProfileCalc () can be used, which includes 
    > an estimation of the envelope surface area
    > an estimation of U-values
    > an energy performance calculation (building and heat supply system) providing the final energy demand (heating + domestic hot water)
    The full energy performance calculation is implemented by the function MobasyCalc (), which includes 
    > the use of the German local climate by postcode
    > an uncertainty assessment
    > a comparison with measured consumption data (target/actual comparison).
    An overview of the method can be found in
