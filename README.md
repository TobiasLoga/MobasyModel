# MobasyModel

### Estimate the energy consumption for heating and DHW by use of a physical model including uncertainty assessment

The package MobasyModel consists of a physical model for calculating the energy demand for heating and domestic hot water.
Monitoring indicators (Energy Profile Indicators) or detailed building data may be used as input data.

For a simple energy performance calculation the function **EnergyProfileCalc ()** can be used, which includes 

- an estimation of the envelope surface area

- an estimation of U-values

- an energy performance calculation (building and heat supply system) providing the final energy demand (heating + domestic hot water)


The full MOBASY calculation is implemented by the function **MobasyCalc ()**, 
which includes in additin to the above mentioned elements:

- the use of the German local climate by postcode

- an uncertainty assessment

- a comparison with measured consumption data (target/actual comparison).


The building data used as input can be loaded from a local Excel file or from an RDA file (R package "MobasyBuildingData").

The main output data can be found in the data frame "Data_Output". 
Interim results are accessible in the data frame "Data_Calc".

the Expected Range of Heating Energy Consumption; Proceedings of the Conference

As a template for the R script the Excel package "EnergyProfile-xlsm.zip" was used.

How ever the results may slightly differ due to different averaging procedures.
